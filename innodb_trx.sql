/*
  INNODB_TRX table is often the most important resource when it comes to investigating *ongoing* transactions.
  As you know, SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUSÂ¥G shows the almost same information as the INNODB_TRX table in the `TRANSACTIONS` section.
  However, in MySQL 5.7 and later, read-only non-locking transactions are not included in the InnoDB monitor transaction list.
  For this reason, it is better to use the INNODB_TRX view, if you need to include all active transactions.
